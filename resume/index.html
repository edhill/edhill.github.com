<h2 class="pagebreak">Recent Experience</h2>

<p>
<b>Sr. Application Architect, Software Developer</b><br/>
1998 - present, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA
</p>

<ul>
<li>Principal duties include defining the University's web application architecture, mentoring staff, and providing both project management and technical leadership needed to complete various projects.</li>
<li>Managed a group of 25 software developers (across 4 teams).  Responsible for hiring staff, coaching developers and team leads, setting performance expectations, providing feedback, and managing priorities.</li>
<li>Responsible for introducing new development technologies (web development, object-oriented programming, ORM frameworks, web services) to approximately 50 software developers.</li>
<li>Responsible for the configuration and management of our production environment (a cluster of approximately 60 Unix machines running java containers (tomcat/play) and services).</li>
<li>Responsible for introducing best practices including source code management (svn/git), issue tracking (jira), build/configuration management (jenkins/findbugs), automated testing (junit/testng), component reuse, releasing small iterations, logging, and run-time application monitoring and management.</li>
<li>Developed strong relationships with customers, peers, and administrators at all levels of the University.</li>
<li>Recipient of various University and departmental awards.</li>
<li>Reputation for attracting and hiring the best developers from smaller departments around campus.</li>
<li>Active developer.  Building software is important to me and I continue to carve out time for development.</li>
    
<br/>
<li>Notable projects include the following:</li>

<ul>
<li><b>MAUI</b> – large project to reengineer all of our student information systems (admissions, enrollment, financial aid, billing, advising). I wear many hats, including the primary technical architect, leading 40 developers.  I’ve led the admissions and financial aid teams (and mentored team leads to replace me).  I developed many significant architecture pieces (GUI framework, rules engine, communication engine).</li>

<li><b>Dispatch</b> - application to manage and distribute both printed and electronic communications; used to create formal documents such as admission letters and university billing statements; allows users to create, schedule, and track email campaigns; has been used to generate 100,000 documents and over a million emails in the first 6 months of use.
	
<li><b>Otto</b> - internal operations tool used to manage MAUI deployments across our cluster; integrates with Graphite and other metrics collection tools to provide insight into our production environment that includes details on system performance, database pools, and user sessions.

<li><b>ISIS</b> - the University's primary student portal, which serves 80,000 students and parents per year; provides access to grades, courses, and other student records; handles thousands of concurrent users during registration, first day of class, and other peak time periods.</li>

<li><b>OSIRIS</b> – provides student records access to faculty and staff; allows staff to enter information about instructors and courses; allows faculty to submit grades electronically; provides management tools to monitor and enforce the security constraints of the system; replaced by MAUI.</li>

<li><b>UI Passport</b> - a single sign-on authentication infrastructure used by all major departments on campus to unify our web login process; works with any web development technology (PHP, ASP, Java, Cold Fusion).</li>

<li><b>Apply Online</b> – electronic admissions applications; smart forms that guide the user through the application process; integrates with PayPal for credit card processing; has various administrator tools to process the forms and reconcile credit card transactions.</li>

<li><b>Hawk IRB</b> – office automation application for the Human Subjects Office; manages all aspects of their office from processing a very complicated project application through inter-office workflow, and scheduling of Institutional Review Board meetings.</li>

<li><b>Budget</b> – port of a Visual Basic application to the web; used by all department budget officers to enter all salary budget information for the University; complex data-entry application that manages millions of dollars every year.</li>

<li><b>UIowa Commons</b> - a suite of classes and tools used to develop J2EE applications quickly at the University of Iowa.  The library contains a number of common utilities and frameworks for database interaction, application configuration and management, and error handling.</li>

<li><b>Display Tag</b> – a reusable tag library used to display a table of information; released as an open source project (now being supported by others) that was somewhat popular in the Java community.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>All of these projects are Java based, used by over a hundred thousand users every day, and I am proud of each one.  Many of these projects were developed, supported, or enhanced beyond my initial implementation with the help of many talented colleagues.</p>
		
<h2 class="pagebreak">Previous Experience</h2>

</ul>

<p>
<b>Software Developer</b><br/>
1991 - 1993, Boss Logic Inc., Fairfield, Iowa
</p>

<ul>
<li>Part of a team that designed and built a commercial document management application (NeXTStep GUI, Sybase database, custom document server). I developed the client application, focusing on the user interface.</li>

<p>
<b>NeXT Campus Consultant, Student Programmer</b><br/>

<ul>
<li>Provided information to students, faculty, and staff that were interested in NeXT computers. Worked on small projects to demonstrate NeXTStep capabilities.</li>
<li>Developed various applications used by faculty members in the Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) Lab. Most software was written in HyperCard, SuperCard, and other Macintosh technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal Education</h2>

<p>
<b>Computer Science &amp; Electrical Engineering</b><br/>
1988 - 1991, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa
</p>

<p>I attended The University of Iowa as a full-time student with a double major in computer science and electrical engineering from 1988-1991. I left school early to join a startup. I have since made some additional progress toward a degree (albeit slowly) while working full-time. I am a few foreign language courses short of a B.A. in computer science which I plan to finish some day.</p>

<p>I keep my technical skills current through self-directed learning, technical experimentation, conferences (QCon, Java One, RailsConf, etc.), weblogs, interacting with peers online and around campus, and extensive reading.</p>
